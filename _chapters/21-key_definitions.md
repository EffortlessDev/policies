# 21â€‹ Key Definitions
* Application: An application hosted by EA, either maintained and created by EA, or maintained and created by a Customer or Partner.
* Application Level: Controls and security associated with an Application. In the case of SaaS Customers, EA does not have access to and cannot assure compliance with security standards and policies at the Application Level.
* Audit: Internal process of reviewing information system access and activity (e.g., log-ins, file accesses, and security incidents). An audit may be done as a periodic event, as a result of a patient complaint, or suspicion of employee wrongdoing.
* Audit Controls: Technical mechanisms that track and record computer/system activities.
* Audit Logs: Encrypted records of activity maintained by the system which provide: 1) date and time of activity; 2) origin of activity (app); 3) identification of user doing activity; and 4) data accessed as part of activity.
* Access: Means the ability or the means necessary to read, write, modify, or communicate data/ information or otherwise use any system resource.
* BaaS: Backend-as-a-Service. A set of APIs, and associated SDKs, for rapid mobile and web application development. APIs offer the ability to create users, do authentication, store data, and store files.
* Backup: The process of making an electronic copy of data stored in a computer system. This can either be complete, meaning all data and programs, or incremental, including just the data that changed from the previous backup.
* Backup Service: A logging service for unifying system and application logs, encrypting them, and providing a dashboard for them.
* Breach: Means the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of protected health information (PHI) in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule which compromises the security or privacy of the PHI. For purpose of this definition, "compromises the security or privacy of the PHI" means poses a significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to the individual. A use or disclosure of PHI that does not include names, telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, social insurance numbers, medical record numbers, bank account numbers, certificate numbers, license numbers, Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers, biometric identifiers (including finger and voice prints), full face photographic images, date of birth, and postal code does not compromise the security or privacy of the PHI. Breach excludes:
    1. Any unintentional acquisition, access or use of PHI by a workforce member or person acting under the authority of a Covered Entity (CE) if such acquisition, access, or use was made in good faith and within the scope of authority and does not result in further use or disclosure in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.
    1. Any inadvertent disclosure by a person who is authorized to access PHI at a CE or BA to another person authorized to access PHI at the same CE or BA, or organized health care arrangement in which the CE participates, and the information received as a result of such disclosure is not further used or disclosed in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.
    1. A disclosure of PHI where a CE or BA has a good faith belief that an unauthorized person to whom the disclosure was made would not reasonably have been able to retain such information.
Covered Entity: A health plan, healthcare clearinghouse, or a healthcare provider who transmits any health information in electronic form.
* De-identification: The process of removing identifiable information so that data is rendered to not be PHI.
* Disaster Recovery: The ability to recover a system and data after being made unavailable.
* Disaster Recovery Service: A disaster recovery service for disaster recovery in the case of system unavailability. This includes both the technical and the non-technical (process) required to effectively stand up an application after an outage.
* Disclosure: Disclosure means the release, transfer, provision of, access to, or divulging in any other manner of information outside the entity holding the information.
* Customers: Contractually bound users of EA Platform.
* Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI): Any individually identifiable health information protected by PIPEDA that is transmitted by, processed in some way, or stored in electronic media.
* Environment: The overall technical environment, including all servers, network devices, and applications.
* Event: An event is defined as an occurrence that does not constitute a serious adverse effect on EA, its operations, or its Customers, though it may be less than optimal. Examples of events include, but are not limited to:
    1. A hard drive malfunction that requires replacement;
    1. Systems become unavailable due to power outage that is non-hostile in nature, with redundancy to assure ongoing availability of data;
    1. Accidental lockout of an account due to incorrectly entering a password multiple times.

* Individually Identifiable Health Information: That information that is a subset of health information, including demographic information collected from an individual, and is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, employer, or health care clearinghouse; and relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual; and identifies the individual; or with respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify the individual.
* Indication: A sign that an Incident may have occurred or may be occurring at the present time. Examples of indications include:
    1. The network intrusion detection sensor alerts when a known exploit occurs against an FTP server. Intrusion detection is generally reactive, looking only for footprints of known attacks. It is important to note that many IDS "hits" are also false positives and are neither an event nor an incident;
    1. The antivirus software alerts when it detects that a host is infected with a worm;
    1. Users complain of slow access to hosts on the Internet;
    1. The system administrator sees a filename with unusual characteristics;
    1. Automated alerts of activity from log monitors;
    1. An alert about file system integrity issues.
* Intrusion Detection System (IDS): A software tool used to automatically detect and notify in the event of possible unauthorized network and/or system access.
* IDS Service: An Intrusion Detection Service for providing IDS notification to customers in the case of suspicious activity.

    1. Electronic PHI has been encrypted by the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a confidential process or key and such confidential process or key that might enable decryption has not been breached. To avoid a breach of the confidential process or key, these decryption tools should be stored on a device or at a location separate from the data they are used to encrypt or decrypt. The following encryption processes meet this standard.
    1. Valid encryption processes for data at rest (i.e. data that resides in databases, file systems and other structured storage systems).
    1. Valid encryption processes for data in motion (i.e. data that is moving through a network, including wireless transmission).
    1. The media on which the PHI is stored or recorded has been destroyed in the following ways:
    1. Paper, film, or other hard copy media have been shredded or destroyed such that the PHI cannot be read or otherwise cannot be reconstructed. Redaction is specifically excluded as a means of data destruction.
    1. Electronic media have been cleared, purged, or destroyed such that the PHI cannot be retrieved.
* Vendors: Persons from other organizations marketing or selling products or services, or providing services to EA.
* Vulnerability: A weakness or flaw in an information system that can be accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited by a threat and lead to a compromise in the integrity of that system, i.e., resulting in a security breach or violation of policy.
* Workstation: An electronic computing device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, or any other device that performs similar functions, used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. Workstation devices may include, but are not limited to: laptop or desktop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet PCs, and other handheld devices. For the purposes of this policy, "workstation" also includes the combination of hardware, operating system, application software, and network connection.
* Workforce: Means employees, volunteers, trainees, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for a covered entity, is under the direct control of such entity, whether or not they are paid by the covered entity.
