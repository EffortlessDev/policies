## ​18.2​ Issue Escalation
EA workforce members are to escalate issues using the procedures outlined in the Employee Handbook. Issues that are brought to the Escalation Team are assigned an owner. The membership of the Escalation Team is maintained by the Chief Executive Officer.

Security incidents, particularly those involving ePHI, are handled using the process described in [Section 10.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/chapters/10-incident_response#policies). If the incident involves a breach of ePHI, the Security Officer will manage the incident using the process described in [Section 11.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/chapters/11-breach#policies). Refer to [Section 10.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/chapters/10-incident_response#policies) for a list of sample items that can trigger EA's incident response procedures; if you are unsure whether the issue is a security incident, contact the Security Officer immediately.

It is the duty of that owner to follow the process outlined below:
1. Create an Issue in the Asana Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Project.
1. The Issue is investigated, documented, and, when a conclusion or remediation is reached, it is moved to Review.
1. The Issue is reviewed by another member of the Escalation Team. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further evaluation and review.
1. If the Issue is approved, it is marked as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
1. The workforce member that initiated the process is notified of the outcome via email.
